This repository stores some basic implementations of the algorithms taught in the Numerical Analysis course. The implementantions were assignments, but the main objective was for the students to have a better idea of how the algorithms work. The course was divided in three unities. Each covering the following topics:

1 - Methods for solving linear systems.
2 - Root finding. Isolation/bracketing Methods. Converging methods . Solving non-linear systems.
3 - ?
